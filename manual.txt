./build.sh compiles all of the files to build folder.

Then in the build folder:
./client <Server IP> <Port Number>
./indirectionServer <micro services ip> <Port Number>
./driver (runs all of the micro services)

Micro services ports are defined in mirco.h
How many seconds until voting is closed is defined in voting.h

1. Translate can translate 5 words from English to French
2. Currency Exchange asks for <amount> <source currency> <destination currency>
with no dollar sign in front of amount and using the 3 letter shortenings for  the currencies
3. Asks the user for a vote if they can vote.
4. Returns a summary if voting is closed.
9. Echo returns the user's messages back.
0. Disconnects the user from the indirection server.

All testing was done at home on a linux desktop and on the linux compute servers.
I was having trouble connecting to 136.159.5.27 but I think it worked one time.

As far as I know all the micro services work. The universal time works for the voting
micro service.
